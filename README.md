# Free Our Knowledge: Community-building repository and discussion forum

### Vision statement
Academia functions like a 'tragedy of the commons' (or collective action problem): open science practices have the potential to benefit the entire research community, but their adoption is impeded by incentive structures that reward sub-optimal research practices and high-impact publications at the individual level. We're building a platform that helps researchers organise the collective uptake of mutually beneficial research practices, so that we can create positive cultural change in academia without placing vulnerable individuals at risk.

### Purposes of this repository
* (1) Discussing collective action campaigns for [Project Free Our Knowledge](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) (via Github Issues -- to propose a new campaign, open a [New Issue](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/documentation/issues/new/choose)) 
* (2) Storing documents and information relating to the project. Note that the open source platform code is hosted separately [here](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/platform).
