# documentation
This repository serves two functions: (1) Storing files and information relating to [Project Free Our Knowledge](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) and (2) Discussing new collective action campaigns to be hosted on platform (via Github Issues). 

#### Support us
If you're new to the project, please help us by doing the following:
* Log in to the [website](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) using ORCID so that we have you on the mailing list (or email info [at] freeourknowledge.org)
* Pledge to any [campaigns](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/#campaigns) that you feel comfortable supporting
* Follow + retweet on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projectfok) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectFOK/)

#### Propose a campaign
If you'd like to propose a new collective action campaign for the platform, open a [New Issue](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/documentation/issues/new/choose) and give it a descriptive title along the lines of "Campaign: Insert Descriptive Title Here". In your first comment, use the following template to orient people to what it is you're trying to achieve and any thoughts you might have on the campaign parameters (it's ok to leave some of these empty, for future discussion):

* Action: What is the action you're asking researchers to carry out (e.g. upload one dataset in the next year)? *-- make sure the action is clearly specified and measurable, so we can check compliance after the campaign goes live!*
* Threshold: When will pledges activate (e.g. when 100 researchers have signed the pledge)? *-- this also needs to be measurable!*
* Eligibility: Are there any constraints on who can sign the pledge (e.g. only psychology researchers, or those who have previously performed a peer-review)?
* Anonymity: Will pledges be public, private, or optional? *-- anonymity will be optional by default, unless you specify otherwise*
* Pledge duration (optional): Is there a time limit on how long the person will be asked to carry out the new action (e.g. for a period of 2 years after the pledge activates)? *-- in many cases this will be irrelevant as the pledge will simply expire after the action is carried out once*
* Campaign expiration (optional): Will the campaign expire if the required number of pledges is not achieved within a certain time frame (e.g. 1 year)?

*Tips for using R-markdown in Github Issues:*
- Use the '\*\' character to make bullet points
- If you want to reference a specific comment, highlight the text of interest and press 'r' (this will copy the referenced text into your reply)
- React to comments by clicking the little emoji
- Format text using [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
