# FOK discussion forum

### Vision statement
We're building a 'crowdacting' platform that helps researchers signal their desire for positive cultural change and then act collectively to bring it about, thus protecting individuals from unecessary risk as we practice open science together.

### Purposes of this repository
* (1) Proposing and discussing collective action campaigns for [Project Free Our Knowledge](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) (via Github Issues, see below). 
* (2) Storing documents and information relating to the project

Note that the open source platform code is hosted separately [here](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/platform).

### How you can support Project FOK
If you're new to the project, please help us by doing the following:
* Watch/star this repository (and if interested, the [platform repository](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/platform/)
* Log in to the [website](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) using ORCID so that we have you on the mailing list (or email info [at] freeourknowledge.org)
* Pledge to any [campaigns](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/#campaigns) that you feel comfortable supporting
* Follow + retweet on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projectfok) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectFOK/)  
* Join the Google Group by [emailing us](mailto: info@freeourknowledge.org)

### Propose a campaign
If you'd like to propose a new collective action campaign for the platform, open a [New Issue](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/documentation/issues/new/choose) and give it a descriptive title along the lines of "Campaign: Insert Descriptive Title Here". New campaigns should conform to the following format: "When X researchers have signed this campaign, they will all do Y together", where X is a target number of researchers (e.g., 100) and Y is a specific action that the signatories plan to take (e.g., post a preprint, or stop reviewing for journals XYZ). In your first comment, fill out the following template to describe what it is you're trying to achieve and your initial thoughts on the campaign design (it's ok if you don't have all the answers!):

* Action: What is the action you're asking researchers to carry out (e.g. upload one dataset in the next year)? *-- ideally the action should be public in some way, so we can monitor compliance after the campaign goes live*
* Threshold: When will pledges activate (e.g. when 100 researchers have signed the pledge)? 
* Eligibility: Are there any constraints on who can sign the pledge (e.g. only researchers in a particular field, or those who have previously performed a peer-review)?
* Anonymity: Will pledges be public, private, or optional? *-- anonymity will be optional by default, unless you specify otherwise (note that all names are made public if the campaign reaches threshold)*
* Pledge duration (optional): Is there a time limit on how long the person will be asked to carry out the new action (e.g. for a period of 2 years after the pledge activates)? *-- in many cases this will be irrelevant as the pledge will simply expire after the action is carried out once*
* Campaign expiration (optional): Will the campaign expire if the required number of pledges is not achieved within a certain time frame (e.g. 1 year)?

*Tips for using R-markdown in Github Issues:*
- Use the '\*\' character to make bullet points
- If you want to reference a specific comment, highlight the text of interest and press 'r' (this will copy the referenced text into your reply)
- React to comments by clicking the little emoji
- Format text using [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
