# Free Our Knowledge: Community-building repository and discussion forum

### Vision statement
**We're building a platform that helps researchers organise the collective uptake of mutually beneficial open research practices, so that we can create positive cultural change in academia without placing vulnerable individuals at risk.** 

### A little more info
Academia functions like a 'tragedy of the commons dilemma' (or [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem)) -- the widespread adoption of open science practices could benefit everyone in the research community, but their adoption is impeded by incentive structures that reward sub-optimal research and publication practices at the individual level. Our [platform](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) functions much like Kickstarter, but for cultural change rather than products. Any researcher can propose a campaign calling for their peers to adopt a particular behaviour *if and when there is a critical mass of support in their community to do so.* Pledges remain inactive and anonymised until this time, allowing vulnerable individuals to signal their desire for positive culture change without risking their career in the process. Then -- after the critical mass is met -- all signatories are de-anonymised on the website and directed to carry out the action together, thus creating momentum for change and protecting one another's interests through collective action. We envisage that over time, these campaigns will grow increasingly larger in size and scope, and eventually become a powerful driving force in aligning the academic system with the needs of research community and principles of science itself.

### Purposes of this repository
* (1) Discussing collective action campaigns for [Project Free Our Knowledge](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) (via Github Issues -- to propose a new campaign, open a [New Issue](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/documentation/issues/new/choose)) 
* (2) Storing documents and information relating to the project. Note that the open source platform code is hosted separately [here](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/platform).
