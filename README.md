# documentation
This repository serves two functions: (1) Storing files and information relating to [Project Free Our Knowledge](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) and (2) Organising and discussing campaigns (via Github Issues). 


**Support us**
If you're new to the project, please help us by doing the following:
* Log in to the [website](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) so that we have you on the mailing list
* Pledge to any [campaigns](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/#campaigns) that you feel comfortable supporting
* Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projectfok) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectFOK/)


**Propose a campaign**
If you'd like to propose a new collective action campaign for the platform, open a [New Issue](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/documentation/issues/new/choose) and give it a descriptive title along the lines of "Campaign: Insert Descriptive Title Here". For your first comment, use the following template to orient people to what it is you're trying to achieve and any other parameters you've already considered:

This campaign will ask researchers to... (describe the action you're asking people to pledge to adopt or forgoe, e.g. upload one dataset in the next year -- this needs to be measurable, so we can check compliance after the campaign goes live!)
Threshold: Your pledge will activate when... (specify when the people singing this pledge will have to carry out the action, e.g. when 100 researchers have signed the pledge -- this also needs to be measurable!) 
Anonymity: Your pledge will be... (public / private / optional -- anonymity will be optional by default, unless you specify otherwise)
Duration (optional): Your pledge will expire after... (is there a time limit to how long the pledge will last? e.g. the researcher commits to adopting the action for 2 years, or after you complete the action once)

Tips for using R-markdown in Github Issues: 
- If you want to reference a specific comment, highlight the text of interest and press 'r' (this will copy the referenced text into your reply)
- React to comments by clicking the little emoji
- Format text using [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
