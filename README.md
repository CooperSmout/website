# documentation
This repository serves two functions: (1) Storing files and information relating to [Project Free Our Knowledge](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) and (2) Discussing new collective action campaigns to be hosted on platform (via Github Issues). 

#### Support us
If you're new to the project, please help us by doing the following:
* Log in to the [website](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) so that we have you on the mailing list
* Pledge to any [campaigns](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/#campaigns) that you feel comfortable supporting
* Follow + retweet on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projectfok) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectFOK/)

#### Propose a campaign
If you'd like to propose a new collective action campaign for the platform, open a [New Issue](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/documentation/issues/new/choose) and give it a descriptive title along the lines of "Campaign: Insert Descriptive Title Here". In your first comment, use the following template to orient people to what it is you're trying to achieve and any thoughts you might have on the other parameters (it's ok to leave some of these empty, for future discussion):

Action: This campaign will ask researchers to pledge to \[describe the action you're asking people to adopt or forgoe, e.g. upload one dataset in the next year] **-- this needs to be measurable, so we can check compliance after the campaign goes live!)**\
Threshold: Pledges will activate when... (specify when the people singing this pledge will have to carry out the action, e.g. when 100 researchers have signed the pledge -- this also needs to be measurable!)\
Anonymity: Pledges will be... (public / private / optional -- anonymity will be optional by default, unless you specify otherwise)\
Duration (optional): Pledges will expire after... (is there a time limit to how long the pledge will last? e.g. the researcher commits to adopting the action for 2 years, or after they complete the action once)

**Tips for using R-markdown in Github Issues:**
- If you want to reference a specific comment, highlight the text of interest and press 'r' (this will copy the referenced text into your reply)
- React to comments by clicking the little emoji
- Format text using [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
