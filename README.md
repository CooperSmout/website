# Free Our Knowledge: Community-building repository and discussion forum

### Vision statement
We're building a platform that helps researchers organise collective action in the pursuit of positive cultural change in academia, so that individuals feel empowered to adopt open and progressive research practices without risking their careers in the process. 

### A little more info
Academia functions like a 'tragedy of the commons dilemma' (or [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem)) -- the widespread adoption of open science practices could benefit everyone in the research community, but their adoption is impeded by incentive structures that reward sub-optimal research/publication practices at the individual level. Our [platform](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) functions much like Kickstarter, but for cultural change rather than products. Any researcher can propose a campaign calling for their peers to adopt a particular behaviour *if and when there is a critical mass of support in their community to do so.* Pledges remain inactive and anonymised until this time, allowing vulnerable individuals to signal their desire for positive culture change without risking their career in the process. Then -- after the critical mass is met -- all signatories are de-anonymised on the website and directed to carry out the action together, thus creating momentum for change and protecting one another's interests through collective action. We envisage that over time, these campaigns will grow increasingly larger in size and scope, and eventually become a powerful driving force in aligning the academic system with the needs of research community and principles of science itself.

### Project structure
Project FOK is divided into two separate repositories:
* (1) a ['platform' repository](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/platform), which is for developing the code behind the [website](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) (you probably don't need to look at that repo unless you're a developer or project admin)
* (2) this 'community' repository, which is for storing documents (e.g., marketing materials) and organising discussions (including the design of new campaigns, using the [Issues feature](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/documentation/issues/new/choose)) 

### How you can support Project FOK
1. Help us by doing the following:
  * Watch/star this repository (and if interested, the [platform repository](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/platform/))
  * Join our [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/dFVBVz)
  * Log in to the [website](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) and pledge to any [campaigns](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/#campaigns) that you support
  * Follow/retweet us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projectfok) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectFOK/)  
  * Join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/free-our-knowledge-community/)
  * Share our [GofundMe campaign](gf.me/u/yvgtgg) (and donate if you can afford to :))
2. Read the project [roadmap](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)
3. Look through the [list of campaign proposals](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues) (any issue starting with 'Campaign') and comment on any that interest you, or add a thumbs up to show your support (this will help us decide which campaigns to post on the website). If you don't see a campaign that you think should be there, propose it by creating a new [issue](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/documentation/issues/new/choose).
4. Comment on any other [project issues](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues) that you have thoughts on.
5. If you're a developer, head over to the [platform repository](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/platform) to see what work needs to be done.
