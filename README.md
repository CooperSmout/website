# FOK discussion forum

### Vision statement
We're building a collective action platform to help researchers organise the widespread, simultaneous adoption of progressive research practices, so that we can create new cultural norms in academia without placing vulnerable individuals at risk.

### Purposes of this repository
* (1) Discussing collective action campaigns for [Project Free Our Knowledge](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) (via Github Issues -- to propose a new campaign, open a [New Issue](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/documentation/issues/new/choose)) 
* (2) Storing documents and information relating to the project. Note that the open source platform code is hosted separately [here](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/platform).
