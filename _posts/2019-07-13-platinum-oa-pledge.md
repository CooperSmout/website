Publicly-funded research should be free to read, reuse and free for authors to publish (“Diamond” or “Platinum Open Access”). High quality Platinum Open Access journals already exist in most disciplines, but typically languish without the support of researchers who feel pressured to publish in 'prestigious' traditional journals. At the same time, however, the research community creates all of the value that determines journal 'prestige', and as such a widespread and simultaneous move to support Platinum Open Access journals would bolster the reputation of those journals and diminish that of legacy journals, breaking the vicious cycle of academic publishing. 

### What is the pledge?
Exclusively publish in, and review for, Open Access scholarly communication outlets that don't charge publication fees (journals that merely pass on DOI-registration costs are permitted under this pledge).

### How is the 'critical mass' of support calculated?
We'll be using a citation-based measure of scientific influence to operationalise the level of support in each research field (e.g., Psychology). Researchers are classified into fields using their ORCID profile. Support is calculated by dividing the average number of citations to pledgers' publications by the average number of citations to all researchers' publications in a particular research field (normalised for each of the last 5 publication years). For these calculations, we will only consider pledgers' publications that are included in their pledge (i.e., authorship position/s).

### When will my pledge become active?
When you pledge, you will select a threshold (0 - 90%, in steps of 10%) that indicates the level of community support at which your pledge will activate. For example, a tenured professor might feel safe boycotting non-compliant journals immediately (i.e., 0% threshold) or with only a small amount of community support (e.g., 10%), whereas an early career researcher might not feel safe boycotting those journals until more of their peers are on board (e.g., 30%). Prior to this threshold being crossed, your pledge will remain anonymous and inactive, meaning that you can pledge without fear of repercussions to your career. 

### What happens then?
If and when your pledge activates, we will publicize your name alongside all of your peers who made the same pledge and direct everyone to carry out their pledge in unison.
