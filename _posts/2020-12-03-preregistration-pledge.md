#### Why join this campaign?
[Preregistration](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019738834-Create-a-Preregistration#Go-to-the-OSF-Prereg-Challenge-landing-page) is a time-stamped, publicly available document that researchers use to specify their research objectives, hypotheses, data collection protocol, and confirmatory analysis plans prior to beginning a study. Preregistration can [improve the reliability of scientific research and hypothesis testing](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2600#sec-15), [mitigate questionable research practices](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2600) and reduce the waste of scientific resources. Although preregistration is commonplace in certain fields (e.g., medicine), it is rare in most others -- in large part due to cultural inertia that discourages straying from the norm. 

By joining this campaign, you will help to make preregistration the norm in your field of research. Although 100 preregistrations may seem like a drop in the ocean, future campaigns can build on this one with increasing numbers until such time that preregistration is the default, rather than the exception.

#### When do I do it?
Your pledge will activate when 100 people from your field have joined the pledge. You will then have two years to preregister a single study. 

#### What happens after I've pledged?
* You will receive an email confirming your pledge to this campaign
* Your pledge is anonymous (unless you specify otherwise) and you don't need to do anything until a critical mass of researchers from your field join the campaign as well. You will receive an email when this happens. At this point, your pledge will become public and you will have two years to complete a study pre-registration on any of the [available pre-registration platforms](https://osf.io/zab38/wiki/home/?view)
