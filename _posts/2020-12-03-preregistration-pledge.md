[Pre-registration](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019738834-Create-a-Preregistration#Go-to-the-OSF-Prereg-Challenge-landing-page) requires researchers to specify their research objectives, hypotheses, data collection protocol, and confirmatory analysis plans prior to beginning a study. 

Pre-registration helps to [improve the reliability of scientific research and hypothesis testing](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2600#sec-15).

A collective campaign to pre-register will help make pre-registration a norm for research. This helps to create a global research environment that supports rigorous research practices.

#### Criteria
* You will receive an email confirming your pledge to this campaign. If you would like to take your pledge further, you can also sign up at the mentor level. 
* Your pledge is anonymous at this stage.
* Your pledge will activate when 100 people from your field have joined the pledge. The two-year time period starts from when the pledge has activated. You will receive an email when this happens. At this point, your pledge will become public.
* From this point, you have two years to complete a study pre-registration: this is a time-stamped, publicly available document that can be verified as existing before the study is conducted. It can be hosted on any of the [available pre-registration platforms](https://osf.io/zab38/wiki/home/?view) come active
