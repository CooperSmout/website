Postprints (peer-reviewed author version of an article) are a cost-effective way to enable access to the latest research ('Green Open Access’), but some publishers deny authors the right to share postprints or place them under unnecessary embargoes. Journals depend entirely on the value donated to them by the research community, however, and will be forced to respond if a critical mass of researchers declare their intention to exclusively support postprint-friendly journals. By joining this campaign, you will pledge to share postprints and only review for journals that explicitly allow postprint sharing without embargo. As with all our campaigns, your pledge will not go into effect until a critical mass of your peers have signed the same pledge (choose your own threshold when you pledge).

### Criteria
* Every time you publish an article closed access (i.e., in a paywalled journal), deposit the final peer-reviewed preprint (i.e., 'postprint') in an indexed repository immediately (i.e., without embargo)
* Every time you review, only review for journals that allow preprints and postprints to be shared without embargo (i.e., 'Green' journals on Sherpa/Romeo)

### How is the level of support calculated?
For this campaign, we'll be using a citation-based measure of scientific influence to operationalise the level of support in each research field (e.g., Psychology). This is calculated by dividing the average number of citations that pledgers' publications received by the average number that all publications received, normalised separately for each of the last 5 publication years (using the geometric mean to control for outliers). We will use ORCID profiles to allocate researchers into different research fields, and only consider publications contained in ORCID profiles that fall under each researcher's pledge conditions (i.e., authorship position/s).

### When will my pledge become active?
When you pledge, you will set an activation threshold (0 - 90%, in steps of 10%) according to your circumstances. For example, a tenured professor may feel more comfortable setting a lower activation threshold (including 0%, which indicates immediate activation) than an early career researcher, who needs publications in community-supported journals to progress their career. You are not required to take any action until the level of support surpasses your selected threshold. At that time, we will publicise your name alongside everyone else who selected that level and direct everyone to carry out their pledge in unison.
