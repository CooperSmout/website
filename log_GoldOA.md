**Rationale**
Publicly-funded research should be free to read and reuse (Open Access), but many journals place articles behind expensive paywalls. Despite clear advantages of Open Access publishing (e.g., increased citation counts), many researchers continue to support paywalled journals because their associated 'prestige' is important for career progression. If a critical mass of researchers were to unanimously declare their intention to support Open Access journals, however, the prestige of these journals would be increased and the community could transition the value they provide with minimal risk to individual researchers.

**Criteria**
* Exclusively publish in, and review for, Open Access journals (listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals)

Note that both the "author pays" (or "author processing charge") and "no-fee" Gold Open Access models are compliant with this pledge (to support the latter, also pledge to the "Platinum Open Access" campaign).
