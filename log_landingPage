##Scholarly publishing is broken##
The scholarly publishing system is inefficient, expensive, and promotes questionable research practices. Intense competition between researchers discourages us from embracing solutions to these problems ('Open Science'), for fear we might risk our careers in the process. Our mission is to ‘kickstart’ progress by first organising a critical mass of support for Open Science practices (e.g. Open Access publishing) and then acting in a coordinated manner to instantiate these practices as new cultural norms. 

##Together we can fix academia##
Researchers have all the power we need to improve scholarly publishing - if we act together. Join each campaign below by pledging to exclusively publish in, and review for, journals that support the specified practice. Your pledge will only apply to papers that you author in positions of your choice (first, middle, or last), and will remain anonymised and inactive until a critical mass of your peers sign the same pledge. At that point, our names will become public and we will all adopt the new behaviour together.
