# Free Our Knowledge Roadmap

### Project Mission & Summary
We're building a platform that helps researchers organise the collective uptake of mutually beneficial research practices, so that we can create positive cultural change in academia without placing vulnerable individuals at risk.

### What do we need to do?
Milestone: Develop, review, and post new series of campaigns to website
* Advertise researchers and open science networks about commenting on/posting new campaigns as Github Issues
* Develop metrics for reviewing campaign proposals
* Coordinate peer-review
* Post X campaigns to website

Milestone: Bring a campaign to fruition and roll-out activation phase
* Advertise campaigns widely (see marketing/Communication_Strategy.md)
* Use [script](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/platform/issues/10) to email signatories with campaign updates
