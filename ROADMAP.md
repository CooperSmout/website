# Free Our Knowledge Roadmap

### Project Mission & Summary
We're building a platform that helps researchers organise the collective uptake of mutually beneficial research practices, so that we can create positive cultural change in academia without placing vulnerable individuals at risk.

### What do we need to do?
#### Milestone: Develop, review, and post new series of campaigns to website
- [x] Develop Github Issue template for users to propose campaigns
- Advertise campaign-creation process to open science ambassadors/networks 
   - [x] Centre for Open Science ambassadors 
   - (copy in relevant channels from marketing/Communication_Strategy.md)
- [ ] [Develop protocol for peer-reviewing campaign proposals](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/discussion/issues/15)
- [ ] Coordinate peer-review
- [ ] Post highest-rated campaign to website
- [ ] Post next-highest-rated campaign after an initial period (perhaps a couple weeks), and so on...

#### Milestone: Bring campaign/s to fruition and roll-out activation phase
* Advertise campaigns widely (see marketing/Communication_Strategy.md)
    * 'Pledge drive'?
* Monitor website traffic (if [developed](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/platform/issues/11)) and use to inform marketing strategy
* Use [script](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/platform/issues/10) to email signatories as campaign progresses
   * update on pledge count
   * motivate them to sign up friends, colleagues
   * inform about new campaigns as they are released
* Monitor campaign progress, consider removing those that don't gain sufficient traction

#### Milestone: Roll-out activation phase after campaign has reached threshold
* Use [script](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/platform/issues/10) to email signatories when first campaign reaches threshold, remind them of their obligations and that their name will be posted on website
* Deanonymise names on website
* Update campaign page to indicate campaign has been successful
* Contact organisations/media agencies to advertise success
