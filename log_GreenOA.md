**Rationale** \
Postprints are the preprint (author-formatted article) that has been updated with changes made during the peer-review process. Postprints are a cost-effective way to enable access to the latest research ('Green Open Accessâ€™), but some publishers place embargoes on postprints or deny their use altogether. If a critical mass of researchers were to unanimously declare their intention to share pre- and post-prints, however, publishers would be compelled to endorse these practices or lose the value donated to them by the research community.

**Criteria** \
* Every time you publish an article closed access (i.e., in a paywalled journal), deposit the final peer-reviewed preprint (i.e., 'postprint') in an indexed repository immediately (i.e., without embargo)
* Every time you review, only review for journals that allow post-prints to be shared without embargo (i.e., 'Green' journals on Sherpa/Romeo)

Your pledge will not go into effect until a critical mass of your peers have signed the same pledge (choose your own threshold below).
