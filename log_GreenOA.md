**Rationale** \
Preprints are a fast and cost-effective way to make findings openly available ('Green Open Access') and enable efficient secondary layers of direct peer-to-peer review (e.g., overlay journals). Some publishers discourage preprints by delaying their sharing ('embargoes') or forbidding their updating after peer-review ('post-print' or 'author accepted manuscript'). If a critical mass of researchers were to unanimously declare their intention to share preprints, however, publishers would be compelled to endorse preprints or risk alienating the research community. 

**Criteria** \
* Every time you publish, deposit the final peer-reviewed preprint (i.e., 'post-print') in an indexed repository without embargo
* Every time you review, only review for journals that allow post-prints to be shared without embargo (i.e., 'Green' journals on Sherpa/Romeo)

Your pledge will not go into effect until a critical mass of your peers have signed the same pledge (choose your own threshold below).
