##Scholarly publishing is broken##
The scholarly publishing system is inefficient, expensive, and promotes questionable research practices. Intense competition between researchers discourages us from embracing solutions to these problems ('Open Science'), for fear we might risk our careers in the process. Our mission is to ‘kickstart’ progress by first organising a critical mass of support for certain Open Science practices (e.g. Open Access publishing), and then acting in a coordinated fashion to instantiate these practices as a new cultural norm.

##Together we can fix academia##
Join the movement by pledging your support for each of the research practices below. For each campaign, you will select a 'support threshold' that determines when your pledge becomes active and deanonymised, thus preventing any risk to your career until you have the support of your research community.
