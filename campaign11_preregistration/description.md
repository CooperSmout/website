This [markdown document](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) will be used to develop and record text related to the [preregistration campaign](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues/11) proposed for the [Free Our Knowledge website](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/). The file is stored in our [Github repository](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community), but can be edited on HackMD for easy use (if you're currently in Github, click the 'Edit on HackMD' button above). The platform is currently built to allow 3 different texts (header, rationale, criteria), but we can change this if there is a good reason to do so. We're planning to test the effects of different campaign descriptions (e.g., positive/negative framing) on sign-up rates, so copy and paste alternative versions as required below.

### Version 1
#### Header
<< SINGLE SENTENCE THAT WILL BE SHOWN ON THE [LANDING PAGE](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) >>

#### Rationale
<< A FEW SENTENCES DESCRIBING THE REASONS WHY THIS CAMPAIGN IS NEEDED >>

#### Criteria
<< BULLET POINTS HIGHLIGHTING ALL THE PLEDGE DETAILS/REQUIREMENTS >>
