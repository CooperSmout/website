subtitle: We are building a platform to help researchers organise collective action in support of open and reproducible research practices

### The problem
Open research practices have the potential to benefit the entire research community, but could also be perceived by some researchers as a threat to their career under the ‘publish-or-perish’ paradigm. For example, the widespread sharing of data and code could allow researchers to validate and build on each others’ work more efficiently, thus saving countless hours of duplicated effort, but some individuals may worry that doing so will place them at a competitive disadvantage. Similarly, the widespread support for platinum open access systems could drastically decrease publication costs and place the control of scholarly communication in the hands of the research community, but individuals may worry that these outlets do not confer sufficient prestige to ensure their survival in a competitive job market. Academic reform thus reflects a ‘collective action problem’, whereby a group of individuals fail to reach a preferable state due to conflicting interests at the personal level. Problems of this kind can often be resolved through ‘collective action’, which occurs when the community in question acts in a coordinated manner to increase their standing while protecting each others’ interests (e.g., a labour strike; Olson, 1965). Although the internet has proven to be a valuable tool for organising collective action throughout distributed communities (e.g., Kickstarter, Collaction), the global research community has yet to embrace this strategy as a potential catalyst for positive cultural change in academia. 

### The vision
Project Free Our Knowledge aims to create positive cultural change by organising collective action in the research community. Using this website, researchers can signal their intentions to adopt progressive research behaviours *if and when there is a pre-determined level of support in the community*. Pledges remain inactive and anonymous if the threshold is not met, thus protecting individuals from potential repercussions. Once the threshold is met, however, the pledging community will be revealed on the website and directed to carry out the action in unison, thus protecting one another's interests as they create change together. Campaign targets will be modest in the short term, e.g., asking hundreds of researchers to post a preprint or complete a preregistration. But over time, as the movement grows, campaigns could grow increasingly bolder in both size and scope, eventually culminating in widespread systemic change and optimising the speed with which we can make progress on important issues of our time (e.g., pandemics, climate change).

### How to get involved
The project is open for community input and collaboration via [Github](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community), where anyone can propose a new campaign by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues/new/choose) or comment on others' proposals. We hope that diverse communities of individuals will come together to decide what they would like the future of academia to look like, and then collaborate to develop campaign parameters that suit the majority of researchers. If you see a campaign that you like, please add a comment or thumbs up to help us work out which campaigns have the most traction in the community. We'd also love it if you could follow us and share our posts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projectFOK) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectFOK) and sign up to our [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/dFVBVz). Any questions can be directed via [Github](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community) or [email](mailto: info@freeourknowledge.org).
