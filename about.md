### Why is this project needed?
Academia is trapped in a [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem). Individual researchers are incentivised to act in ways that hold back progress and hurt the research community's best interests (e.g., publishing in legacy journals and prioritising novelty over reliability). Any one individual could take a stand against this pressure, of course, but by doing so they would be placing their career at risk. Fears like these have held back progress in academia to the point where today, decades after the internet was developed, we continue to communicate and evaluate research using outdated journal models developed for the 18th century printing press.

### How could we fix this problem?
Imagine if every researcher in the world decided that from tomorrow, we would only support community-owned, no-fee ('platinum') open access scholarly communication systems. Overnight, the prestige of legacy journals -- which depend entirely on the value we provide -- would plummet, and the reputation of whatever systems we chose to support would skyrocket, allowing us to reclaim control of scholarly communication, open our research to the world, drastically decrease costs, and begin to evolve scholarly communication in line with our needs and the principles of science itself. Now, obviously this is an extreme example, but it serves to demonstrate the latent power researchers hold and the potential benefits of **collective action** to individual researchers.

### What are we doing?
We're building the world's first collective action platform for researchers. Using our website, researchers can make anonymous pledges to support certain progressive (e.g., open science) behaviours *if and when a critical mass of support for that behaviour is met in the community*. Then -- after the pre-determined number of pledges is reached -- we will publicize the new community on our website and direct them to carry out the action together, thus protecting each otherâ€™s interests as they drive progress together.

### What is our vision for the future? 
In the early days, we expect our campaigns to target simple actions (e.g., posting a preprint or uploading some data) and ask small numbers (tens or hundreds) of researchers to gently nudge their field in the directions they want to follow. Successful campaigns (those that reach the target threshold) can then be built on in future campaigns, which can target increasingly larger cohorts of researchers to take bolder steps toward academic reform. Eventually, with growing support, it is conceivable that entire research fields could effect widespread, systemic change in a relatively short period of time, vastly improving our own working conditions as we cooperate to build a better academia for all. 

### How can you help?
The best way to support this project is to take a pledge! And obviously, tell your friends and colleagues. We'd also love it if you could follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projectFOK) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectFOK), share our posts and sign up to our [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/dFVBVz). Beyond that, there are plenty other ways to get involved with the project -- please check out our [Join Us] page to see how.

### Who are we?
Project Free Our Knowledge is a grassroots movement driven by early career researchers who seek a better future for ourselves, our friends and our colleagues. At present, the project is being driven by:

* [Cooper Smout](https://www.coopersmout.com/) (Primary lead)
* [Dawn Liu Holford](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/liuda52701/dawn-holford)

Supported by:

* Jay Patel
* Megan Campbell
* Kelly Garner
* Claire Bradley
* Udi Alter
* Gavin Taylor

And advised by:

* Luis Pedro Coelho
* Lillian Juma
* Alex Holcombe
* Brian Nosek
