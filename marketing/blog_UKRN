The UKRN is partnering with Project Free Our Knowledge to help researchers organise collective action in the pursuit of academic reform, so that individuals can feel empowered to adopt open and progressive research practices without risk to their careers.

**The problem**\
Progress in academia is limited by a [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem) (or 'tragedy of the commons'): because individuals are incentivised to compete against one another, they fail to cooperate and reach a more optimal solution that could potentially benefit everyone. For example, researchers often publish their work in 'prestigious' legacy journals, which may benefit the individual, but ultimately costs the collective research community a large portion of its research funding (through subscription fees or author processing charges) and prevents progressive, community-owned journals from gaining a foothold in the publishing marketplace. Similarly, researchers might not publish their data or code out of a fear that doing so will cost them valuable time or give others a competitive edge, but by keeping this information secret the community cannot build upon one another's work and collaborate more effectively. Problems like these (and many others) in academia could potentially be solved if a critical mass of the community were to adopt the progressive behaviour as a new cultural norm, simultaneously, thus allowing individuals to support positive cultural change without risking their careers in the process. Although this type of strategy -- known as 'collective action' -- is a well-known solution to problems of this kind (Ohlson, 1967), it remains to be used effectively to resolve collective action problems in academia. 

**The vision**\
Project FOK aims to accelerate the adoption of open and reproducible research practices by organising collective action in academia. Using the website, researchers can signal their intentions to adopt progressive research behaviours *if and when there is a pre-determined level of support in the community* (think of this like Kickstarter, but for cultural change rather than products). These pledges remain inactive and anonymous if the threshold is not met, thus protecting individuals from any negative repercussions. But once the threshold is met, the pledging community will be revealed on the website and directed to carry out the action in unison, thus protecting one another's interests as they drive positive cultural change together. In the short term, campaigns will most likely be small in size and scope, e.g., asking hundreds of researchers to post a preprint or complete a preregistration. But over time, as the movement grows, campaigns could potentially grow larger in both size and scope, eventually becoming a powerful driving force for change in academia and accelerating progress on the most important issues of our times (e.g., pandemics, climate change).

**How to get involved**\
The project is now open for community input and collaboration, via their [Github repository](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community). Any researcher can [propose a new campaign or idea](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues/new/choose) and comment on others' proposals. The team are hoping that this becomes a diverse, community-driven effort, and so we invite UKRN members to get involved by commenting on (or adding a thumbs up to) any campaign proposals that interest you (e.g., [publishing registered reports](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues/8), [completing preregistrations](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues/11)) and proposing any new campaign ideas that align with your interests (including those that support your own initiatives!). Following a period of [community peer-review](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues/15), these new campaigns will then be put out to the crowd via the project [website](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/).
