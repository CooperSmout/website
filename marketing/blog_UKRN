The UKRN is partnering with Project Free Our Knowledge to help organise collective action in academia, so that individuals can feel empowered to adopt open and reproducible research practices without risking their careers in the process.

**The problem**\
Progress in academia is limited by a [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem) (or 'tragedy of the commons') -- because individuals are incentivised to compete against one another, they fail to cooperate and reach a more optimal solution that could potentially benefit everyone. For example, researchers continue to publish their work in privately-owned legacy journals due to the 'prestige' they confer, but collectively these practices costs the research community billions of dollars in research funding every year (through subscription fees or author processing charges) and prevent progressive, community-owned journals from gaining a foothold in the publishing marketplace. Similarly, researchers might not publish their data or code out of a fear that doing so will cost them valuable time or give others a competitive edge, but by keeping this information secret the community cannot build upon one another's work and collaborate more effectively. Collective action problems like these could be resolved if a critical mass of the community were to agree to adopt the progressive behaviour as a new cultural norm, thus allowing individuals to support positive cultural change without risking their careers in the process. Although this type of strategy -- known as 'collective action' -- is a well-known solution to problems of this kind (Ohlson, 1967), there remains to be a concerted effort by the global research community to address collective inertia in academia. 

**The vision**\
Project FOK aims to accelerate the adoption of open and reproducible research practices by organising collective action in academia. Using a [website](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/), researchers can signal their intentions to adopt progressive research behaviours *if and when there is a pre-determined level of support in the community* (think of this like Kickstarter, but for cultural change rather than products). These pledges remain inactive and anonymous if the threshold is not met, thus protecting individuals from potentially harmful repercussions. But once the threshold is met, the pledging community will be revealed on the website and directed to carry out the action in unison, thus protecting one another's interests as they drive cultural change together. In the short term, campaigns will most likely be small in size and scope, e.g., asking hundreds of researchers to post a preprint or complete a preregistration. But over time, as the movement grows, campaigns could potentially grow larger in both size and scope, eventually becoming a powerful driving force for change in academia and accelerating progress on the most important issues of our times (e.g., pandemics, climate change).

**How to get involved**\
The project is now open for community input and collaboration, via their [Github repository](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community). Any researcher can [propose a new campaign or idea](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues/new/choose) and comment on previous proposals. The team are hoping that this becomes a diverse, community-driven effort, and so we invite UKRN members to get involved by looking through the [campaign proposals](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues) and commenting on (or adding a thumbs up to) any that interest you, or proposing any other ideas for campaigns that can support your research community and relevant initiatives. Following a period of [community peer-review](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues/15), these new campaigns will then be put out to the crowd via the project [website](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/).
