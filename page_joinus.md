### Join us

We believe in creating a better system that works for *all* scholars, but we need your help! If you'd like to collaborate on the project, please get in touch via [email](mailto:info@freeourknowledge.org), [twitter](https://twitter.com/projectFOK), [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectFOK/), or [github](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community). Here are some ways you can contribute:

*Comment on campaign proposals*. Head over to our [Github repository](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community) and comment on any [campaign drafts or project issues](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues) that interest you, or just add a thumbs up to help us choose which campaigns to post next. 

*Design a campaign.* If you have an idea for a new campaign that hasn't been proposed yet, open a new [Issue](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues/new/choose) and fill out the campaign proposal template.

*Ambassadors*. We're looking for people who can help spread the word to friends and colleagues within their institutions and research fields (e.g. via presentations, social media, and casual discussions).

*Donate/share our crowdfunding campaign*. We are a researcher-driven initiative and currently 100% self-funded. If you can afford a few dollars to sponsor our platform development, or would be willing to share to your networks, please do so [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/rpjkz-test). 

*Communications and marketing*. We're looking for skilled communicator/s who can help spread the word about this project (e.g. via social media, blogs, articles, and advertising).

*Data management*. We'll be collecting large numbers of pledges with this project and need to keep that information confidential but also amenable to various analyses. As such, we're looking for people with experience organising and securing confidential data.

*Software development*. There's plenty to do on both the front- and back-end software development. We need to develop code to compute and display support metrics on the website and to coordinate pledge activation when various support thresholds are crossed.

*UX design*. The current platform is in a minimal viable product state, and we're looking for collaborators to help redesign and develop the user experience (coded in Jekkyl for Github Pages). 

*Metascience*. As the data comes in, it will be useful to analyse it along various dimensions to gauge community support (e.g. researcher career-level, country, institution, etc.). These analyses will then be displayed on the website and contribute to publications and blogs describing the platform usage.
