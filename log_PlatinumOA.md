**Rationale** \
Publicly-funded research should be free to read, reuse and free for authors to publish (“Diamond” or “Platinum Open Access”). In many fields, Platinum Open Access journals already exist but do not receive many submissions due to their relatively low impact factors. The academic community creates nearly all of the value that determines journal 'prestige', however, and as such a widespread and simultaneous statement of exclusive support for the Platinum Open Access model would bolster the reputation of these journals, decrease the incentive to publish in non-compliant subscription or author-pays journals, and allow the community to transition the value we provide to more efficient and cost-effective journals with minimal risk to individual researchers.

**Criteria** \
* Exclusively publish in, and review for, Open Access journals that do not charge publication fees (listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals). Journals that charge only DOI-registration costs are permitted under this pledge.

Your pledge will not go into effect until a critical mass of your peers have signed the same pledge (choose your own threshold below).
