Thanks for proposing a new collective action campaign for Project Free Our Knowledge! New campaigns should follow the format: "When X researchers have signed this campaign, we will all do Y together", where X is a target number of researchers and Y is a specific action that the signatories plan to take. If your campaign doesn't fit this format, please get in touch with the project team to discuss.

  Instructions:
  1. Add your campaign title in the Title field above ^
  2. Add your GitHub username and anyone else who will be developing this campaign below --->
Campaign lead/s:

  3. Fill in the template below (it's ok if you don't have all the answers yet) and click 'Submit new issue'  ---> 
* Rationale: *Why is this campaign needed? Try to keep this succinct.*
* Action: *What is the action that pledgers will carry out (e.g. upload one dataset)? Ideally this should be public in some way, so we can monitor compliance after pledges activate.*
* Eligibility: *Are there any constraints on who can sign the pledge (e.g. only researchers in a particular field)?*
* Anonymity: *Will pledgers have the option to hide their names prior to their pledge activating? (note that all names are made public if the campaign reaches threshold, irrespective of this setting)*
* Threshold: *What is the critical mass of signatures that will trigger the pledges to activate (e.g. 100)?*
* Campaign expiration: *Will the campaign expire if the threshold is not reached within a certain time frame (e.g. 1 year)?*
* Pledge duration: *Is there a time limit on how long pledges remain active (e.g., 2 years)? (in many cases this will be irrelevant as the pledge will simply expire after the action is carried out once)
