Thanks for proposing a new collective action campaign for Project FOK! Campaigns should follow the general format: "When X researchers have signed this campaign, they will all do Y together", where X is a target number of people and Y is a specific action that they plan to take. If your campaign doesn't fit this format, please get in touch with the project team to discuss.

  Instructions:
  1. Add your campaign title in the Title field above ^
  2. Add your GitHub @username and anyone else who will be developing this campaign below --->

  3. Fill in as much of the following information as you can. It's ok if you don't have all the answers just yet, and feel free to delete any parts that aren't relevant. Start with a brief description of why this campaign is needed (try to be succinct) ---> 
* Rationale:

  4. What is the action that signatories will carry out (e.g. upload one dataset)? Ideally this should be public in some way, so we can monitor compliance after pledges activate. If there's any further details you'll need to also specify them here (e.g., a list of boycotted/whitelisted journals). --->
* Action:

  5. Describe if there are any constraints on who can sign the pledge (e.g. only researchers in a particular field): --->
* Eligibility criteria:

  6. Will signatories have the option to remain anonymous prior to their pledge activating? (note that all names are made public once the campaign reaches threshold, irrespective of this setting) --->
* Optional anonymity: yes/no

<!---
  7. What is the critical mass of signatures that will trigger the pledges to activate (e.g. 100)? --->
* Threshold: 

<!---
  8. Will the campaign expire if the threshold is not reached within a certain time frame (e.g. 1 year)? --->
* Campaign expiration:

<!---
  9. Is there a time limit on how long pledges remain active (e.g., 2 years)? (in many cases this will be irrelevant as the pledge will simply expire after the action is carried out once) --->
* Pledge duration:
